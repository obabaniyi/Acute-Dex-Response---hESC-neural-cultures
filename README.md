This repository contains 2 R Scripts I used to analyze RNAseq data from my project, modeling acute glucocorticoid response in hESC-derived neural cultures. I used these scripts to perform DESeq2 analysis on count data from cDNA libraries, sequenced from mRNA samples from neural cultures treated for 6 hours with Dexamethasone, and aligned to the human reference genome. The file starting with "H9" was used to analyze count data from the H9-hESC experiment. H1 file, likewise, was used to analyze count data from the H1-hESC experiment.
